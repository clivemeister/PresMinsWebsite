### Short guided meditations
These are nice meditations for when you have just a few minutes. For best effect, try and sit for meditation every day - ten or twelve minutes isn't too much time to take for yourself, after all!

### Meditations to help with sleep
Many people have problems getting to sleep, either when they first go to bed, or when they wake in the night. These meditations use techniques from Yoga Nidra to take your body into a state of sleep, or deep relaxation. Science tells us that deep relaxation is about 80% as effective as sleep, so if that's where you get to, then that's fine.

### Longer meditations
Once you're training your meditative muscles, you might want to keep going for a little longer. These meditations will help you do that.

This next meditation is designed to help build introspective awareness - our awareness of our own thinking processes. It's a really important skill to build, and can help you significantly in your everyday life (your time "off the cushion", as mediators sometimes call it...)
