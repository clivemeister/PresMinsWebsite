I'm trying to help people find ways to bring the benefits of meditation
to their everyday life.  Meditation shouldn't be about achieving some
particular state of mind only when "on the cushion" - the benefits should
be felt much more widely, across all our lives, and should be accessible
in times of stress, anger, confusion, or difficulty, when we may need
them the most.
