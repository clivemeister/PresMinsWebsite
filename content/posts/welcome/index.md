This is life, sat in front of a beautiful bay in southern Thailand, ancient limestone jutting up in the mists behind. Incredibly calm and relaxing, easy to be mindful and in the moment. 

But everyday isn't like that, is it? We have work to go to, kids to sort out, a to-do list as long as your arm, and that's before FOMO and in-boxes and #whatever and and... life.

So how do we balance this? How do we find ways to capture some of that mindful, relaxed, approach, but fit it in to our modern lives? Indeed, is this ancient wisdom still in any way relevant today?

I think it is. And that's my mission. To help us all engage with the world as it is every day, and be *better* for it.

If you want to join us in our journey, I send out an email irregularly (never more than a couple a month), with whatever is on my mind at the time. Please do subscribe to this list.

 There are also a number of recorded meditations that you can listen to any time.
 
 Right now I'm also teaching regular meditation and mindfulness sessions over Zoom to people all over the world - drop me a line at clive@presentminutes.co.uk if you're interested in this.
